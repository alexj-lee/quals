To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, here we analysed 23,822 cells from two areas at distant poles of the mouse neocortex: the primary visual cortex and the anterior lateral motor cortex. We define 133 transcriptomic cell types by deep, single-cell {RNA} sequencing. Nearly all types of {GABA} (γ-aminobutyric acid)-containing neurons are shared across both areas, whereas most types of glutamatergic neurons were found in one of the two areas. By combining single-cell {RNA} sequencing and retrograde labelling, we match transcriptomic types of glutamatergic neurons to their long-range projection specificity. Our study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct areas of the adult mouse cortex.},

However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein ({EGFP})-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the {EGFP}-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease.},

We determined the expression of cadherins and cell-type markers in 29,933 cells and the projections of 3,164 cells in both the mouse motor cortex and auditory cortex. Associating gene expression and projections in 1,349 neurons revealed shared cadherin signatures of homologous projections across the two cortical areas. These cadherins were enriched across multiple branches of the transcriptomic taxonomy. By correlating multigene expression and projections to many targets in single neurons with high throughput, {BARseq}2 provides a potential path to uncovering the molecular logic underlying neuronal circuits.},

Here, we used {RNA} sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types.},

Here we used massively parallel tagging of progenitors to track clonal relationships and transcriptomic signatures during mouse forebrain development. We quantified clonal divergence and convergence across all major cell classes postnatally, and found diverse types of {GABAergic} neuron that share a common lineage. Divergence of {GABAergic} clones occurred during embryogenesis upon cell-cycle exit, suggesting that differentiation into subtypes is initiated as a lineage-dependent process at the progenitor cell level.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of mesoscopic brain connectivity is important for understanding inter- and intraregion information processing. Models of structural connectivity are typically constructed and analyzed with the assumption that regions are homogeneous. We instead use the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas to construct a model of whole-brain connectivity at the scale of 100 μm voxels. The data consist of 428 anterograde tracing experiments in wild type C57BL/6J mice, mapping fluorescently labeled neuronal projections brain-wide. Inferring spatial connectivity with this dataset is underdetermined, since the approximately 2 × 105 source voxels outnumber the number of experiments. To address this issue, we assume that connection patterns and strengths vary smoothly across major brain divisions. We model the connectivity at each voxel as a radial basis kernel-weighted average of the projection patterns of nearby injections. The voxel model outperforms a previous regional model in predicting held-out experiments and compared with a human-curated dataset. This voxel-scale model of the mouse connectome permits researchers to extend their previous analyses of structural connectivity to much higher levels of resolution, and it allows for comparison with functional imaging and other datasets., Anatomical tracing experiments can provide a wealth of information regarding connectivities originating from the injection sites. However, it is difficult to integrate all this information into a comprehensive connectivity model. In this study we construct a high-resolution model of the mouse brain connectome using the assumption that connectivity patterns vary smoothly within brain regions, and we present several extensions of this model. We believe that this higher resolution connectome will be of great use to the community, enabling comparisons with other data modalities, such as functional imaging and gene expression, as well as for theoretical studies.},

Here, we present nonnegative spatial factorization ({NSF}), a spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model based on transformed Gaussian processes that naturally encourages sparsity and scales to tens of thousands of observations. {NSF} recovers ground truth factors more accurately than real-valued alternatives such as {MEFISTO} in simulations, and has lower out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic {NMF} on three spatial transcriptomics datasets from mouse brain and liver. Since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial correlations, we also propose a hybrid extension of {NSF} that combines spatial and nonspatial components, enabling quantification of spatial importance for both observations and features.

The inherent complexity of such data makes it a challenge to extract biological information. We developed {staNMF}, a method that combines a scalable implementation of nonnegative matrix factorization ({NMF}) with a new stability-driven model selection criterion. When applied to a set of Drosophila early embryonic spatial gene expression images, one of the largest datasets of its kind, {staNMF} identified 21 principal patterns ({PP}). Providing a compact yet biologically interpretable representation of Drosophila expression patterns, {PP} are comparable to a fate map generated experimentally by laser ablation and show exceptional promise as a data-driven alternative to manual annotations. Our analysis mapped genes to cell-fate programs and assigned putative biological roles to uncharacterized genes. Finally, we used the {PP} to generate local transcription factor regulatory networks. Spatially local correlation networks were constructed for six {PP} that span along the embryonic anterior–posterior axis. Using a two-tail 5\% cutoff on correlation, we reproduced 10 of the 11 links in the well-studied gap gene network. The performance of {PP} with the Drosophila data suggests that {staNMF} provides informative decompositions and constitutes a useful computational lens through which to extract biological insight from complex and often noisy gene expression data.},

	abstract = {The mammalian brain is composed of millions to billions of cells that are organized into numerous cell types with specific spatial distribution patterns and structural and functional properties. An essential step towards understanding brain function is to obtain a parts list, i.e., a catalog of cell types, of the brain. Here, we report a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell type atlas for the whole adult mouse brain. The cell type atlas was created based on the combination of two single-cell-level, whole-brain-scale datasets: a single- cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) dataset of ∼7 million cells profiled, and a spatially resolved transcriptomic dataset of ∼4.3 million cells using {MERFISH}. The atlas is hierarchically organized into five nested levels of classification: 7 divisions, 32 classes, 306 subclasses, 1,045 supertypes and 5,200 clusters. We systematically analyzed the neuronal, non-neuronal, and immature neuronal cell types across the brain and identified a high degree of correspondence between transcriptomic identity and spatial specificity for each cell type. The results reveal unique features of cell type organization in different brain regions, in particular, a dichotomy between the dorsal and ventral parts of the brain: the dorsal part contains relatively fewer yet highly divergent neuronal types, whereas the ventral part contains more numerous neuronal types that are more closely related to each other. We also systematically characterized cell-type specific expression of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and transcription factors. The study uncovered extraordinary diversity and heterogeneity in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and co-expression patterns in different cell types across the brain, suggesting they mediate a myriad of modes of intercellular communications. Finally, we found that transcription factors are major determinants of cell type classification in the adult mouse brain and identified a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines cell types across all parts of the brain. The whole-mouse-brain transcriptomic and spatial cell type atlas establishes a benchmark reference atlas and a foundational resource for deep and integrative investigations of cell type and circuit function, development, and evolution of the mammalian brain.},

Yet, the molecular identities of the cell types, and their positions within individual anatomical structures, remain incompletely known. To construct a comprehensive atlas of cell types in each brain structure, we paired high-throughput single-nucleus {RNA}-seq with Slide-seq, a recently developed spatial transcriptomics method with near-cellular resolution, across the entire mouse brain. Integration of these datasets revealed the cell type composition of each neuroanatomical structure. Cell type diversity was found to be remarkably high in the midbrain, hindbrain, and hypothalamus, with most clusters requiring a combination of at least three discrete gene expression markers to uniquely define them. Using these data, we developed a framework for genetically accessing each cell type, comprehensively characterized neuropeptide and neurotransmitter signaling, elucidated region-specific specializations in activity-regulated gene expression, and ascertained the heritability enrichment of neurological and psychiatric phenotypes. These data, available as an online resource ({BrainCellData}.org) should find diverse applications across neuroscience, including the construction of new genetic tools, and the prioritization of specific cell types and circuits in the study of brain diseases.},

This preparatory activity has been observed across cortical layers, including in descending pyramidal tract neurons in layer 5. A key question is how preparatory activity is maintained without causing movement, and is ultimately converted to a motor command to trigger appropriate movements. Here, using single-cell transcriptional profiling and axonal reconstructions, we identify two types of pyramidal tract neuron. Both types project to several targets in the basal ganglia and brainstem. One type projects to thalamic regions that connect back to motor cortex; populations of these neurons produced early preparatory activity that persisted until the movement was initiated. The second type projects to motor centres in the medulla and mainly produced late preparatory activity and motor commands. These results indicate that two types of motor cortex output neurons have specialized roles in motor control.},

Here we summarize the evidence for graded transcriptomic heterogeneity being present, widespread, and functionally relevant in the nervous system. We explain how these graded differences can map onto higher-order organizational features and how they may reframe existing interpretations of higher-order heterogeneity.

We sought to identify, delineate, and manipulate this putatively parallel architecture in the dorsal subiculum, the primary output subfield of the dorsal hippocampus. Population and single-cell {RNA}-seq revealed that the subiculum can be divided into two spatially adjacent subregions associated with prominent differences in pyramidal cell gene expression. Pyramidal cells occupying these two regions differed in their long-range inputs, local wiring, projection targets, and electrophysiological properties. Leveraging gene-expression differences across these regions, we use genetically restricted neuronal silencing to show that these regions differentially contribute to spatial working memory.

Using next-generation {RNA} sequencing, we identified striking variability in {CA}1 {PCs}, such that the differences within {CA}1 along the dorsal-ventral axis rivaled differences across distinct pyramidal neuron classes. This variability emerged from a spectrum of continuous gene-expression gradients, producing a transcriptional profile consistent with a multifarious continuum of cells.

Here, we review the extent of this within-cell-type heterogeneity in one of the simplest cortical regions of the mammalian brain, the rodent hippocampus. We focus on the mounting evidence that the classical {CA}3, {CA}1 and subiculum pyramidal cell types all exhibit prominent and spatially patterned within-cell-type heterogeneity, and suggest these cell types provide a model system for exploring the organization and function of such heterogeneity.

Manual mapping of heterogeneous {CA}3 pyramidal neuron expression patterns demonstrates an unexpectedly complex molecular parcellation into a relatively coherent set of nine expression domains in the septal/temporal and proximal/distal axes with reciprocal, nonoverlapping boundaries. Unique combinatorial profiles of adhesion molecules within these domains suggest corresponding differential connectivity, which is demonstrated for {CA}3 projections to the lateral septum using retrograde labeling.

These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture 1–3, connectivity4,5, and neuronal activity 6–10, are wired into modular networks4,5,11. However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures. Here we used {BARseq}, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 107 cell type marker genes in 1.2 million cells over a mouse forebrain hemisphere at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell {RNAseq} studies12,13. Within medium-grained cell types that are shared across all cortical areas, gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas. The compositions of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. We grouped cortical areas into modules so that areas within a module, but not across modules, had similar compositions of transcriptomic types. Strikingly, these modules match cortical subnetworks that are highly interconnected 4,5,11, suggesting that cortical areas that are similar in cell types are also wired together. This “wire-by-similarity” rule reflects a novel organizing principle for the connectivity of cortical areas. Our {BARseq}-based strategy is high-throughput and low-cost, and scaling up this approach to many animals can potentially reveal the brain-wide molecular architecture across individuals, developmental times, and disease models.},
