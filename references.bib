	abstract = {Comprehensive knowledge of the brain's wiring diagram is fundamental for understanding how the nervous system processes information at both local and global scales. However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein ({EGFP})-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the {EGFP}-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease.},

Here, we introduce {BARseq}2, a technique that simultaneously maps projections and detects multiplexed gene expression by in situ sequencing. We determined the expression of cadherins and cell-type markers in 29,933 cells and the projections of 3,164 cells in both the mouse motor cortex and auditory cortex. Associating gene expression and projections in 1,349 neurons revealed shared cadherin signatures of homologous projections across the two cortical areas. These cadherins were enriched across multiple branches of the transcriptomic taxonomy. By correlating multigene expression and projections to many targets in single neurons with high throughput, {BARseq}2 provides a potential path to uncovering the molecular logic underlying neuronal circuits.},

We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types.},

We quantified clonal divergence and convergence across all major cell classes postnatally, and found diverse types of {GABAergic} neuron that share a common lineage. Divergence of {GABAergic} clones occurred during embryogenesis upon cell-cycle exit, suggesting that differentiation into subtypes is initiated as a lineage-dependent process at the progenitor cell level.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of mesoscopic brain connectivity is important for understanding inter- and intraregion information processing. Models of structural connectivity are typically constructed and analyzed with the assumption that regions are homogeneous. We instead use the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas to construct a model of whole-brain connectivity at the scale of 100 μm voxels. The data consist of 428 anterograde tracing experiments in wild type C57BL/6J mice, mapping fluorescently labeled neuronal projections brain-wide. Inferring spatial connectivity with this dataset is underdetermined, since the approximately 2 × 105 source voxels outnumber the number of experiments. To address this issue, we assume that connection patterns and strengths vary smoothly across major brain divisions. We model the connectivity at each voxel as a radial basis kernel-weighted average of the projection patterns of nearby injections. The voxel model outperforms a previous regional model in predicting held-out experiments and compared with a human-curated dataset. This voxel-scale model of the mouse connectome permits researchers to extend their previous analyses of structural connectivity to much higher levels of resolution, and it allows for comparison with functional imaging and other datasets., Anatomical tracing experiments can provide a wealth of information regarding connectivities originating from the injection sites. However, it is difficult to integrate all this information into a comprehensive connectivity model. In this study we construct a high-resolution model of the mouse brain connectome using the assumption that connectivity patterns vary smoothly within brain regions, and we present several extensions of this model. We believe that this higher resolution connectome will be of great use to the community, enabling comparisons with other data modalities, such as functional imaging and gene expression, as well as for theoretical studies.},

Here, we present nonnegative spatial factorization ({NSF}), a spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model based on transformed Gaussian processes that naturally encourages sparsity and scales to tens of thousands of observations. {NSF} recovers ground truth factors more accurately than real-valued alternatives such as {MEFISTO} in simulations, and has lower out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic {NMF} on three spatial transcriptomics datasets from mouse brain and liver. Since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial correlations, we also propose a hybrid extension of {NSF} that combines spatial and nonspatial components, enabling quantification of spatial importance for both observations and features.

	abstract = {The mammalian brain is composed of millions to billions of cells that are organized into numerous cell types with specific spatial distribution patterns and structural and functional properties. An essential step towards understanding brain function is to obtain a parts list, i.e., a catalog of cell types, of the brain. Here, we report a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell type atlas for the whole adult mouse brain. The cell type atlas was created based on the combination of two single-cell-level, whole-brain-scale datasets: a single- cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) dataset of ∼7 million cells profiled, and a spatially resolved transcriptomic dataset of ∼4.3 million cells using {MERFISH}. The atlas is hierarchically organized into five nested levels of classification: 7 divisions, 32 classes, 306 subclasses, 1,045 supertypes and 5,200 clusters. We systematically analyzed the neuronal, non-neuronal, and immature neuronal cell types across the brain and identified a high degree of correspondence between transcriptomic identity and spatial specificity for each cell type. The results reveal unique features of cell type organization in different brain regions, in particular, a dichotomy between the dorsal and ventral parts of the brain: the dorsal part contains relatively fewer yet highly divergent neuronal types, whereas the ventral part contains more numerous neuronal types that are more closely related to each other. We also systematically characterized cell-type specific expression of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and transcription factors. The study uncovered extraordinary diversity and heterogeneity in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and co-expression patterns in different cell types across the brain, suggesting they mediate a myriad of modes of intercellular communications. Finally, we found that transcription factors are major determinants of cell type classification in the adult mouse brain and identified a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines cell types across all parts of the brain. The whole-mouse-brain transcriptomic and spatial cell type atlas establishes a benchmark reference atlas and a foundational resource for deep and integrative investigations of cell type and circuit function, development, and evolution of the mammalian brain.},

Yet, the molecular identities of the cell types, and their positions within individual anatomical structures, remain incompletely known. To construct a comprehensive atlas of cell types in each brain structure, we paired high-throughput single-nucleus {RNA}-seq with Slide-seq, a recently developed spatial transcriptomics method with near-cellular resolution, across the entire mouse brain. Integration of these datasets revealed the cell type composition of each neuroanatomical structure. Cell type diversity was found to be remarkably high in the midbrain, hindbrain, and hypothalamus, with most clusters requiring a combination of at least three discrete gene expression markers to uniquely define them. Using these data, we developed a framework for genetically accessing each cell type, comprehensively characterized neuropeptide and neurotransmitter signaling, elucidated region-specific specializations in activity-regulated gene expression, and ascertained the heritability enrichment of neurological and psychiatric phenotypes. These data, available as an online resource ({BrainCellData}.org) should find diverse applications across neuroscience, including the construction of new genetic tools, and the prioritization of specific cell types and circuits in the study of brain diseases.},

This preparatory activity has been observed across cortical layers, including in descending pyramidal tract neurons in layer 5. A key question is how preparatory activity is maintained without causing movement, and is ultimately converted to a motor command to trigger appropriate movements. Here, using single-cell transcriptional profiling and axonal reconstructions, we identify two types of pyramidal tract neuron. Both types project to several targets in the basal ganglia and brainstem. One type projects to thalamic regions that connect back to motor cortex; populations of these neurons produced early preparatory activity that persisted until the movement was initiated. The second type projects to motor centres in the medulla and mainly produced late preparatory activity and motor commands. These results indicate that two types of motor cortex output neurons have specialized roles in motor control.},

Notably, in addition to revealing the organization of this distinct cell-type landscape, the technology has also begun to illustrate that continuous variation can be found within narrowly defined cell types. Here we summarize the evidence for graded transcriptomic heterogeneity being present, widespread, and functionally relevant in the nervous system. We explain how these graded differences can map onto higher-order organizational features and how they may reframe existing interpretations of higher-order heterogeneity.

We sought to identify, delineate, and manipulate this putatively parallel architecture in the dorsal subiculum, the primary output subfield of the dorsal hippocampus. Population and single-cell {RNA}-seq revealed that the subiculum can be divided into two spatially adjacent subregions associated with prominent differences in pyramidal cell gene expression. Pyramidal cells occupying these two regions differed in their long-range inputs, local wiring, projection targets, and electrophysiological properties. Leveraging gene-expression differences across these regions, we use genetically restricted neuronal silencing to show that these regions differentially contribute to spatial working memory. This work provides a coherent molecular-, cellular-, circuit-, and behavioral-level demonstration that the hippocampus embeds structurally and functionally dissociable streams within its serial architecture.},

Here, we considered a well-defined canonical neuronal population—hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal cells ({CA}1 {PCs})—and systematically examined the extent and spatial rules of transcriptional heterogeneity. Using next-generation {RNA} sequencing, we identified striking variability in {CA}1 {PCs}, such that the differences within {CA}1 along the dorsal-ventral axis rivaled differences across distinct pyramidal neuron classes. This variability emerged from a spectrum of continuous gene-expression gradients, producing a transcriptional profile consistent with a multifarious continuum of cells. This work reveals an unexpected amount of variability within a canonical and narrowly defined neuronal population and suggests that continuous, within-class heterogeneity may be an important feature of neural circuits.},

Historically, such cell types were broadly defined by their correspondence to gross features of the nervous system (such as cytoarchitecture). Modern-day neuroscientific techniques, enabling a more nuanced examination of neuronal properties, have illustrated a wealth of heterogeneity within these classical cell types. Here, we review the extent of this within-cell-type heterogeneity in one of the simplest cortical regions of the mammalian brain, the rodent hippocampus. We focus on the mounting evidence that the classical {CA}3, {CA}1 and subiculum pyramidal cell types all exhibit prominent and spatially patterned within-cell-type heterogeneity, and suggest these cell types provide a model system for exploring the organization and function of such heterogeneity. Given that the hippocampus is structurally simple and evolutionarily ancient, within-cell-type heterogeneity is likely to be a general and crucial feature of the mammalian brain.},

Manual mapping of heterogeneous {CA}3 pyramidal neuron expression patterns demonstrates an unexpectedly complex molecular parcellation into a relatively coherent set of nine expression domains in the septal/temporal and proximal/distal axes with reciprocal, nonoverlapping boundaries. Unique combinatorial profiles of adhesion molecules within these domains suggest corresponding differential connectivity, which is demonstrated for {CA}3 projections to the lateral septum using retrograde labeling.

These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture 1–3, connectivity4,5, and neuronal activity 6–10, are wired into modular networks4,5,11. However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures. Here we used {BARseq}, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 107 cell type marker genes in 1.2 million cells over a mouse forebrain hemisphere at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell {RNAseq} studies12,13. Within medium-grained cell types that are shared across all cortical areas, gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas. The compositions of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. We grouped cortical areas into modules so that areas within a module, but not across modules, had similar compositions of transcriptomic types. Strikingly, these modules match cortical subnetworks that are highly interconnected 4,5,11, suggesting that cortical areas that are similar in cell types are also wired together. This “wire-by-similarity” rule reflects a novel organizing principle for the connectivity of cortical areas. Our {BARseq}-based strategy is high-throughput and low-cost, and scaling up this approach to many animals can potentially reveal the brain-wide molecular architecture across individuals, developmental times, and disease models.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing brain connectivity at sufficient resolution for computational models designed to study the biophysical mechanisms underlying cognitive processes is extremely challenging. For such a purpose, a mesoconnectome that includes laminar and cell-class specificity would be a major step forward. We analyzed the ability of gene expression patterns to predict cell-class and layer-specific projection patterns and assessed the functional annotations of the most predictive groups of genes. To achieve our goal we used publicly available volumetric gene expression and connectivity data and we trained computational models to learn and predict cell-class and layer-specific axonal projections using gene expression data. Predictions were done in two ways, namely predicting projection strengths using the expression of individual genes and using the co-expression of genes organized in spatial modules, as well as predicting binary forms of projection. For predicting the strength of projections, we found that ridge (L2-regularized) regression had the highest cross-validated accuracy with a median r2 score of 0.54 which corresponded for binarized predictions to a median area under the {ROC} value of 0.89. Next, we identified 200 spatial gene modules using a dictionary learning and sparse coding approach. We found that these modules yielded predictions of comparable accuracy, with a median r2 score of 0.51. Finally, a gene ontology enrichment analysis of the most predictive gene groups resulted in significant annotations related to postsynaptic function. Taken together, we have demonstrated a prediction workflow that can be used to perform multimodal data integration to improve the accuracy of the predicted mesoconnectome and support other neuroscience use cases.},

However, current computational methods for annotating spatially resolved single-cell data are typically based on techniques established for dissociated single-cell technologies and thus do not take spatial organization into account. Here we present {STELLAR}, a geometric deep learning method for cell-type discovery and identification in spatially resolved single-cell datasets. {STELLAR} automatically assigns cells to cell types present in the annotated reference dataset and discovers novel cell types and cell states. {STELLAR} transfers annotations across different dissection regions, different tissues and different donors, and learns cell representations that capture higher-order tissue structures. We successfully applied {STELLAR} to {CODEX} multiplexed fluorescent microscopy data and multiplexed {RNA} imaging datasets. Within the Human {BioMolecular} Atlas Program, {STELLAR} has annotated 2.6 million spatially resolved single cells with dramatic time savings.},

To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, here we analysed 23,822 cells from two areas at distant poles of the mouse neocortex: the primary visual cortex and the anterior lateral motor cortex. We define 133 transcriptomic cell types by deep, single-cell {RNA} sequencing. Nearly all types of {GABA} (γ-aminobutyric acid)-containing neurons are shared across both areas, whereas most types of glutamatergic neurons were found in one of the two areas. By combining single-cell {RNA} sequencing and retrograde labelling, we match transcriptomic types of glutamatergic neurons to their long-range projection specificity. Our study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct areas of the adult mouse cortex.},

Moreover, {MEFISTO} can integrate multiple related datasets by simultaneously identifying and aligning the underlying patterns of variation in a data-driven manner.

Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied {MOFA} to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, {RNA} expression, {DNA} methylation and ex vivo drug responses. {MOFA} identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress.

Physiological studies in humans and rodents have suggested that there is both structural and functional heterogeneity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. However, the recent discovery of discrete gene expression domains in the mouse hippocampus has provided the opportunity to re-evaluate hippocampal connectivity. To integrate mouse hippocampal gene expression and connectivity, we mapped the distribution of distinct gene expression patterns in mouse hippocampus and subiculum to create the Hippocampus Gene Expression Atlas ({HGEA}). Notably, previously unknown subiculum gene expression patterns revealed a hidden laminar organization. Guided by the {HGEA}, we constructed the most detailed hippocampal connectome available using Mouse Connectome Project (http://www.mouseconnectome.org) tract tracing data. Our results define the hippocampus’ multiscale network organization and elucidate each subnetwork’s unique brain-wide connectivity patterns.},

Here, we describe an unsupervised and interpretable computational framework to (1) pre-process 3D spatial gene expression datasets by imputation of missing voxels, (2) identify principal patterns ({PPs}) of 3D spatial gene expression profiles using the stability-driven non-negative matrix factorization ({staNMF}) technique, and (3) systematically compare these {PPs} to known anatomical regions and ontology. This framework, referred to as {osNMF} (ontology discovery via {staNMF}), identifies {PPs} that are derived purely from thousands of 3D spatial gene expression profiles in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. These 3D {PPs} present stable and spatially coherent regions of the mouse brain, potentially without human labor and bias. We demonstrate that {osNMF} {PPs} offer new brain patterns that are highly correlated with combinations of expert-annotated brain regions, while also identifying a unique ontology based purely on spatial gene expression data. Compared to principal component analysis ({PCA}) and other clustering algorithms, our {PPs} exhibit better spatial coherence, more accurately match expert labeling and are more stable across multiple bootstrapped simulations. We also used {osNMF} to define marker genes and build putative spatial gene interaction networks. Our findings highlight the capability of {osNMF} to rapidly generate new atlases from a large set of spatial gene expression data without supervision and uncover novel relationships between brain regions that were difficult to discern using conventional manual approaches.},

The abundance of spatial expression data in recent years has led to the modeling and analysis of regulatory networks. The inherent complexity of such data makes it a challenge to extract biological information. We developed {staNMF}, a method that combines a scalable implementation of nonnegative matrix factorization ({NMF}) with a new stability-driven model selection criterion. When applied to a set of Drosophila early embryonic spatial gene expression images, one of the largest datasets of its kind, {staNMF} identified 21 principal patterns ({PP}). Providing a compact yet biologically interpretable representation of Drosophila expression patterns, {PP} are comparable to a fate map generated experimentally by laser ablation and show exceptional promise as a data-driven alternative to manual annotations. Our analysis mapped genes to cell-fate programs and assigned putative biological roles to uncharacterized genes. Finally, we used the {PP} to generate local transcription factor regulatory networks. Spatially local correlation networks were constructed for six {PP} that span along the embryonic anterior–posterior axis. Using a two-tail 5\% cutoff on correlation, we reproduced 10 of the 11 links in the well-studied gap gene network. The performance of {PP} with the Drosophila data suggests that {staNMF} provides informative decompositions and constitutes a useful computational lens through which to extract biological insight from complex and often noisy gene expression data.},

Standard "dense" implementations of convolutional networks are very inefficient when applied on such sparse data.

This paper develops a self-regularized graph neural network ({SR}-{GNN}) solution that improves the architecture stability by regularizing the filter frequency responses in the graph spectral domain. The {SR}-{GNN} considers not only the graph signal as input but also the eigenvectors of the underlying graph, where the signal is processed to generate task-relevant features and the eigenvectors to characterize the frequency responses at each layer. We train the {SR}-{GNN} by minimizing the cost function and regularizing the maximal frequency response close to one. The former improves the architecture performance, while the latter tightens the perturbation stability and alleviates the information loss through multi-layer propagation. We further show the {SR}-{GNN} preserves the permutation equivariance, which allows to explore the internal symmetries of graph signals and to exhibit transference on similar graph structures. Numerical results with source localization and movie recommendation corroborate our findings and show the {SR}-{GNN} yields a comparable performance with the vanilla {GNN} on the unperturbed graph but improves substantially the stability.},

	abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics can provide quantitative molecular signatures for large, unbiased samples of the diverse cell types in the brain1–3. With the proliferation of multi-omics datasets, a major challenge is to validate and integrate results into a biological understanding of cell-type organization. Here we generated transcriptomes and epigenomes from more than 500,000 individual cells in the mouse primary motor cortex, a structure that has an evolutionarily conserved role in locomotion. We developed computational and statistical methods to integrate multimodal data and quantitatively validate cell-type reproducibility. The resulting reference atlas—containing over 56 neuronal cell types that are highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies and modalities—is a comprehensive molecular and genomic account of the diverse neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex. The atlas includes a population of excitatory neurons that resemble pyramidal cells in layer 4 in other cortical regions4. We further discovered thousands of concordant marker genes and gene regulatory elements for these cell types. Our results highlight the complex molecular regulation of cell types in the brain and will directly enable the design of reagents to target specific cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex for functional analysis.},

	abstract = {Research in several fields now requires the analysis of datasets in which multiple high-dimensional types of data are available for a common set of objects. In particular, The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) includes data from several diverse genomic technologies on the same cancerous tumor samples. In this paper we introduce Joint and Individual Variation Explained ({JIVE}), a general decomposition of variation for the integrated analysis of such datasets. The decomposition consists of three terms: a low-rank approximation capturing joint variation across data types, low-rank approximations for structured variation individual to each data type, and residual noise. {JIVE} quantifies the amount of joint variation between data types, reduces the dimensionality of the data, and provides new directions for the visual exploration of joint and individual structure. The proposed method represents an extension of Principal Component Analysis and has clear advantages over popular two-block methods such as Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares. A {JIVE} analysis of gene expression and {miRNA} data on Glioblastoma Multiforme tumor samples reveals gene-{miRNA} associations and provides better characterization of tumor types.},

	abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation jeopardizes the validity of statistical inference, for example correlation and regression analysis. Restricted randomization methods can account for the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the observed data by building it into an empirical null model for hypothesis testing. This can be achieved, for example, based on conditional simulation, which fits a highly parameterized geostatistical model to the observed spatial structure, or, for data observed on a regular transect or grid, with Fourier spectral randomization methods that can flexibly model spatial structure at any scale. This study uses Moran eigenvector maps to extend spectral randomization to irregularly spaced samples. We present different algorithms to perform restricted randomization to suit different types of research questions: individual randomization of each variable, joint randomization of a group of variables while keeping within-group correlations fixed, and randomization with a fixed correlation between original data and randomized replicates (e.g. as input for simulation studies). The performance of the proposed Moran spectral randomization methods for regularly and irregularly spaced samples is assessed with correlation analysis of simulated data. Moran spectral randomization closely matched the spatial structure of original simulated data sets, with identical or nearly identical Moran's I values and power spectra, depending on the algorithm. In correlation analysis of two spatially autocorrelated variables, Moran spectral randomization produced correct type I error rates for stationary spatial data, even for very small and highly irregular samples, but was sensitive to linear trend. When one or both variables lacked spatial structure, Moran spectral randomization tests were more conservative than correlation t-tests. The proposed Moran spectral randomization method requires a minimum of parameterization and is able to address multivariate data with spatial structure at multiple scales, with the option of controlling levels of correlation with the original data. It can provide technically unlimited numbers of randomizations even for small samples while closely maintaining the spatial characteristics of uni- or multivariate data at all spatial scales. The method is applicable for correlation analysis of stationary, autocorrelated spatial or temporal series. Further research should assess whether the method can be extended to multiple regression analysis.},
